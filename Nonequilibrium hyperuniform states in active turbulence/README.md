## Overview

This repository provides the **simulation and analysis code** for studying hyperuniform patterns emerging from active turbulence — a phenomenon observed in dense bacterial suspensions and other self-propelled matter.

### What is Active Turbulence?

Active fluids are materials composed of self-propelled entities (like bacteria) that convert stored energy into mechanical motion. Unlike conventional turbulence driven by external forces, **active turbulence** arises spontaneously from internal stresses generated by the swimmers themselves.

This creates a fascinating state:
- Chaotic flow patterns at small scales
- Jets and swirling vortices
- Complex collective behavior

### What is Hyperuniformity?

**Hyperuniformity** is a hidden order in seemingly disordered systems. While the vortex centers appear randomly distributed locally, they exhibit suppressed density fluctuations at large scales — more uniform than random chance would predict.

Mathematically, a system is hyperuniform if its structure factor:

$$S(k) \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad k \to 0$$

This property is significant because it suggests that chaotic active flows can self-organize into globally ordered patterns, connecting non-equilibrium physics to crystallography.

### Why Does This Matter?

Understanding hyperuniformity in active systems has implications for:

- **Biophysics**: How bacterial colonies organize collectively
- **Materials Science**: Designing active materials with controlled properties  
- **Statistical Physics**: Non-equilibrium phase transitions and pattern formation
- **Soft Matter**: Self-organization in living systems

## What This Code Does

The project implements a complete pipeline:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Simulate<br/>Active Flow] --> B[Detect<br/>Steady State]
    B --> C[Find Vortex<br/>Centers]
    C --> D["Compute S\(k\) &<br/>Check Hyperunif."]
```

1. **Simulation**: Solves the generalized Navier-Stokes equations with scale-dependent viscosity (PVC model)
2. **Steady State Analysis**: Identifies equilibrated flow configurations
3. **Extrema Search**: Locates vortex centers (local minima/maxima of vorticity)
4. **Hyperuniformity Analysis**: Computes structure factor S(k) and fits power-law exponents
