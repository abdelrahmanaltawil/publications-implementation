# publications-implementation
This is a repository that records my personal implementation of my research publications or publications I find interesting.

## Format of implementation
Implementation formats vary by publication. Projects are typically developed as Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts structured according to my [algorithm-template](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanAltawil/algorithm-template) repository.
