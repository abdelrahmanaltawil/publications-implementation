# publications-implementation
This is a repository that record my personal implementation of publications i found interesting. The areas of interests of the implemented publications would mainly be around the following areas.
- Search  & Optimization algorithms.
- Numerical Methods for solving physical models.
- Machine Learning.

## Format of implementation
The main principle followed in these implementation is portability. Hence **all implementation are written in Jupyter notebook formate**. This will allow for better exchange of knowledge and involvement of the community.
